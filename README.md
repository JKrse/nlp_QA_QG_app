# Question Answering & Question Generation prototype

# Getting started
It's super easy, we promise!

## Preprare Envirorment
To install necesarry dependencies run the setup file
```
python setup.py install
```

The setup file will install the packages: 
- streamlit 
- gitpython
- nltk (python -m nltk.downloader punkt)
- allennlp (1.0.0)
- allennlp_models
- transformers (3.0.0)

Also a clone of hte clone the git repository `question_generation` will be downloaded. 

All credits to patil-suraj for making a awesome end-to QG framework that mimics ðŸ¤— transformers pipeline for easy inference (https://github.com/patil-suraj/question_generation).

## Running streamlit 

Once streamlit and the other dependicies are installed you can simple run the app:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will run in a localhost server.

# Models
The app is essential a *wrapper* for a number of models glued together with a friendly user interface. None of the models are fine-tuned and are simple implemented using a user friendly API *pipeline* format.

## Question Answering
For the Question Answering module four pre-trained models have been implemented:
1. ELMo-BiDAF (Trained on SQuAD) 
2. BiDAG (Trained on SQuAD)
3. DistilBERT (distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad)
4. BERT (bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad)

Where 1) and 2) are AllenNLP models and 3) and 4) are HuggingFace models. 

## Question Generation
The Question Generation is a pre-trained model with three pipeline tasks:
1. question-generation: for single task question generation models
2. multitask-qa-qg: for multi-task qa,qg models
3. e2e-qg: for end-to-end question generation

With the option of using a model sizes "small" or a "base" (https://huggingface.co/models). All models are easily implemented but for this demo ***only the end-to-end question generation is included in this demo (both the small and base model)***. For fine-tuning the models please look at the patil-suraj's git repository.

# COLAB Notebook
To play around with all of models can be both demanding in storage (~6gb) and can be computationally. To cope with this a COLAB notebook has been developed, which enables you to run the streamlit app through COLAB. Models are now stored and computationen made on using Google service.

Note you will need to modify the script a little bit by adding your own ngrok to generate the localhost server.
